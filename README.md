## Description

_This website is designed to suggest programming languages to those interested in diving into Web development. There are 5 somewhat irrelevent questions that gather info and send it through a js tree to determine which language to recommend. Along with each recommendation is a list of links where the user can find more information specific to the language. There is also a sidebar with more general resources on getting started. While the quiz may be ... humourous... the information is meant to encourage and educate the user_

* _use git to clone repo to desktop: https://github.com/CharWeber/Program-selector_
